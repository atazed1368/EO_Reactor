Catalyst performance decline
The activity of both HA and HS catalyst gradually declines over time and as a
function of cumulative production. The decline is probably due to both feed
impurities and agglomeration of silver on the catalyst surface. The catalyst
decline rate has varied significantly amongst licensees due to variation in
feedstock impurities and severity of operation and possibly other factors.
It has been found profitable to remove as much as possible trace impurities
from the feed gases to prolong catalyst life. Refer to Process Memorandum
107 for details of various catalyst poisons.
Frequent review of catalyst performance both by the plant in cooperation with
catalyst vendor is warranted to ensure optimum operation of the catalyst.
As activity declines, the yield decreases, requiring increasing coolant
temperatures and pressures to increase conversion.
